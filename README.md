# restricted-fs-additional-code
This repository is an accompaniment to the report for a master's thesis, which documents the update to Firedrake to implement a ``RestrictedFunctionSpace`` class.

This code contains some example code shown in the report, as well as code to produce some of the plots shown with respect to solving eigenproblems using Firedrake.
